Based on the provided code and energy usage data, here are some suggestions for further optimization:

* Use a more memory-efficient data structure to store the `numbers` list. Instead of using a Python list, consider using a NumPy array or a SciPy sparse matrix, which can reduce memory usage by eliminating unnecessary padding between elements.
* Implement the pairwise products calculation using a more efficient algorithm. The current approach uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of numbers in the `numbers` list, which can be computationally expensive for large lists. Consider using the NumPy broadcasting feature or the SciPy sparse matrix product function to calculate the pairwise products more efficiently.
* Use the Python `profile` module to identify hotspots in the code that consume a disproportionate amount of energy. This can help you focus on the most critical parts of the code and optimize them accordingly.
* Consider using a more efficient data structure for storing the pairwise products matrix. Instead of using a dense NumPy array, consider using a sparse matrix format such as COO (coordinate list) or CSR (compressed sparse row). This can reduce memory usage and improve performance for large datasets.
* Use the Python `cprofile` module to profile the code and identify bottlenecks in the execution pipeline. This can help you optimize the most critical parts of the code and reduce energy consumption.
