# Code Release for 2025 ICSE-NIER Submission: E2COOL - Towards Energy Efficient Code Optimizations with Large Language Models
## About
This repository contains all the artifacts of the project “E2COOL: Towards Energy Efficient Code Optimizations with Large Language Models.” It includes scripts, implementation details, and instructions necessary to reproduce the results and experiments discussed in our submission.

Our artifact includes the following
Item | Corresponding content in the paper | Relevant Directory | Relevant Scripts
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Energy Aware Prompting (EAP) | Section III.B, especially Figure 1 and 2 | llm/src | llm/src/new_llm_optimize.py
Energy Optimization Evaluation (EOE) | Section III.B, especially Figure 2 | energy/src | llm/src/regression_test.py, energy/src/evaluator.py
Software Benchmark | Section III.C | /benchmarks | energy/src/benchmark.py
Power Consumption Measurement | Section III.C | /RAPL | energy/src/measure_energy.py
Comparison of Results with GCC –O3 | Section IV.D | /test_results | 

## Environment Requirement
This artifact requires a machine with the following capabilities to support RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) and read MSR (Model-Specific Registers):

1. **Hardware**
- Intel Processor: Machine with Intel processors supporting RAPL (Sandy Bridge or newer).
- MSR Support: Machine must allow access to MSRs.

2. **Operating System**
- Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04+).
- Linux Kernel Version 3.13+ required for RAPL support.
- Root Access: MSRs can only be accessed with root/superuser privileges.

3. **Software**
- msr-tools: Install for reading MSRs:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install msr-tools

## Reproduce Results
To set up the pipeline for energy-efficient code optimization, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <project-directory>
2. **Install the required dependencies using the Makefile**
    ```bash
   make setup
3. **Create .env in root directory**
    This should include:
    ```bash
    API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    USER_PREFIX=/path/to/EEDC
4. **Update RAPL/main.c write path**
    Change line 31 to match your absolute path
    ```bash
    strcpy(path, “ABSOLUTE_PATH/EEDC/energy/src/");
    ```
    Then run make in RAPL directory
    ```bash
    make
## Running the pipeline
5. **Run the main script**
    ```bash
    make run (benchmark name)
    ```
    For example, to run the Binary Trees benchmark,
   ```bash
   make run binarytrees.gpp-9.c++
   ```
    

## Analysis and evaluation

The results of the optimizations are stored in "/llm/benchmarks_out/(benchmark name)/"
In 'results_file.txt', information about every optimization iteration is stored in the format:
```
(Iteration #): [
   optimized code,
   energy consumed,
   runtime
]
```

## Code Dependencies
Software we relied on (included in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ArjunGupte44/EEDC/blob/fall2024/requirements.txt):
```
openai==1.50.1
pydantic==2.9.2
pydantic_core==2.23.4
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```
