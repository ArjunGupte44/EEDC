prompt = """Research Project on Data Center Cost Reduction:
As a computer science researcher, you are part of a team dedicated to a research project aimed at reducing costs in data centers by optimizing software processes. Your specific focus is on improving the algorithmic efficiency of code, targeting the runtime of specific algorithmic processes.

Project Background:
The overarching goal is to enhance the efficiency of software to reduce resource utilization and operational costs in data centers. Algorithmic efficiency is a key aspect, emphasizing the need for optimized runtimes in various code segments.

Specific Task:
Your current assignment is to improve the algorithmic efficiency of a given code snippet. The objective is to find a more optimal solution while being mindful of when further optimization is impractical.

Criteria for Optimization:
Consider the following criteria in the optimization process:
- Time and space complexity analysis.
- Reduction of nested loops.
- Efficient data structure selection.
- Dynamic programming or memoization opportunities.
- Utilization of specialized algorithms.
- Code simplicity and readability.
- Profiling tools and code analysis.

Instructions:
Provide a detailed process for optimizing the algorithmic efficiency of the given code.
Include any relevant changes made to the original code.
Explain why the rewritten code is more efficient, addressing specific criteria and considerations.
Be mindful of practical limits; recognize when further optimization may not be feasible.
Provide the rewritten code and then explicitly mention what is different between the original code and updated code.
Otherwise tell say it cannot be optimized anymore.

Here is the original code.
